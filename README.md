# Image_Clustering_Flowers
## Unsupervised Machine Learning Model clusters unlabeled flower photos into clusters.
Using Keras, VGG16 convolutional neural network clustering, 210 flower images are clustered into 10 clusters by their features

## Data

Dataset is from a Kaggle competition below:

As it is needed to use the dataset for Unsupervised Machine Learning, types of flowers are removed during pre-prosesssing.
