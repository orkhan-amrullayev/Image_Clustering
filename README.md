# Image_Clustering_Flowers
## Unsupervised Machine Learning Model clusters unlabeled flower photos into groups.
Using Keras, VGG16 convolutional neural network clustering, hundreds of different kinds of flower images are clustered into 10 groups by their visual features

## Dataset

Dataset is from a Kaggle competition below. The competetion is considered for classification (Supervised Learning) of the flowers, but in our case we removed the labels of the images that indicats their types for clustering purposes (Unsupervised Learning).
